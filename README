Game Description:
This game is called "Shoot them all". The game reaches to conclusion when the player's health goes down to zero. Till then he has to
shoot as many rockets as he can. If he shoots the player by bullet then the score is incremented by one point. And if the player himself
collides with rocket, the score is incremented by 5 points. The points that the player accumulates before his health goes down is his final score.
